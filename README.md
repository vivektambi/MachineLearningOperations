# Project Overview
	The project "Operationalizing Machine Learning" is a part of Udacity ML Nanodegree.
	In this project, we build, deply and consume an Azure ML pipeline using Python SDK, and Swagger Documentation.

# Future Improvements
	1. In the dataset I am using for AutoML model, I will introduce new variables to increase the power of features in the modelling.
	2. In real life ML problems, batches of new data are introduced at regular intervals. Training on the latest data will make our model more robust. 
	Hence, I will introduce an automation where the training happens on regular intervals(hourly/daily/weekly etc.)
